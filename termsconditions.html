    <p>
        These Terms constitute the comprehensive legal agreement between you and TigerGames, governing your use of the
        Services, and supersede any prior agreements between you and TigerGames pertaining to the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge that TigerGames failure to exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy as outlined in these
        Terms
        (or rights held by TigerGames under applicable law) does not constitute a formal waiver of TigerGames' rights,
        and
        such rights or remedies shall remain available to TigerGames.
    </p>
    <p>
        TigerGames reserves the right to provide you with notifications, including those regarding alterations to these
        Terms, via email, traditional mail, SMS, or postings on the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that a court of law, possessing jurisdiction in this matter, deems any provision within these Terms
        as
        invalid, that specific provision shall be removed from the Terms without affecting the remainder of the Terms.
        The
        remaining provisions of the Terms will remain valid and enforceable.
    </p>
    <p>
        These terms and conditions shall be interpreted and governed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of
        India.
        Any disputes shall fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of New Delhi.
    </p>

    <p>
        If an entire provision or any part of a provision within these terms and conditions is considered void,
        unenforceable, or illegal within a particular jurisdiction, that provision, or, if allowable, the relevant
        portion
        thereof, will be severed for that jurisdiction. The rest of the Terms and Conditions will continue to hold full
        force and effect, and the validity or enforceability of that provision within any other jurisdiction will remain
        unaffected. This clause will not apply if severance fundamentally alters the core nature of the Terms and
        Conditions
        or if it contradicts public policy.
